This is a quick front end made to demonstrate a coffee shop api

After cloning, run yarn to download dependencies.

enter an id in the search field and click the button to bring up a customer.
It will generate a JSX component displaying their name, the number of stamps they
have received and the number of coffees they can redeem as well as button to add a
stamp and redeem a coffee. Those buttons are not functional but there is a bug where
the page doesn't refresh. Sending the patch requests clearly does not change state as
I hoped.

There is an add customer field and a submission button that works.
